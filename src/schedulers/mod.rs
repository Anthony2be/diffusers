//! The schedule functions, denoted Schedulers in the library take in the output of a trained model, a sample which the
//! diffusion process is iterating on, and a timestep to return a denoised sample.
//!
//! * Schedulers define the methodology for iteratively adding noise to an image or for updating a sample based on model
//! outputs.
//!   - adding noise in different manners represent the algorithmic processes to train a diffusion model by adding noise
//!     to images.
//!   - for inference, the scheduler defines how to update a sample based on an output from a pretrained model.
//! * Schedulers are often defined by a noise schedule and an update rule to solve the differential equation
//! solution.
